\begin{abstract}
We develop econometric methods for an  important
econometric issue.
We illustrate its application using an R package `xxyy'
and recent data.
This paper also illustrates the use of R in macro-econometrics.

xyz is an important unsolved problem in Econometrics.
The aim of this paper is threefold.

Now, we show how to include a figure in the paper and
how to refer to it.  The folder should have the 
file named `figCVS.pdf' for the following to work.

\end{figure}
Figure  \ref{fig.fit} shows how the kernel regression fit is
excellent compared to OLS.

\section{Review of Stylized Facts}
See Table \ref{tab.lit} for a review of some stylized facts.

THIS TEMPLATE shows one way of including a table containing text
in a Latex document.

\begin{tabular}{ll}

Interest rates & Stylized Facts\\
\hline
\hline
 Call money market rate & Usually exhibits large volatility\\ 
 Bank rate & Usually non-varying in nature \\ 
 Prime Lending rate	& A potential indicator of long term rate and exhibits stickiness\\ 
 Redemption yield -& A potential indicator of long term rate in case of shift from -\\

\section{Frish's Problem and Rao's Solution}
--sample file -- sample file----
--sample file -- sample file----

Linear regressions are common in Econometrics even though
nonlinear nonparametric methods are receiving attention these days.
Ragnar Frisch, winner of 1969 Nobel in Economics,
had posed the following problem before the
Oxford Conference of the Econometric Society in September 1936. Let
$x_1$ and $x_2$ be two variables such that
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq.frisch}
x_1 &= a \xi + \epsilon_1, \nonumber \\
x_2 &= b \xi + \epsilon_2,
\end{eqnarray}
where $\xi, \epsilon_1, \epsilon_2$ are independent random variables,
and where $a, b$ are unknown constants.  Frish's problem
was: What are the conditions under which the regression of $x_1$ on
$x_2$ is linear?


\cite{Rao47} and \cite{Rao49} 
assume that: (i) expectations $E(\xi), E(\epsilon_1),$ 
and $E(\epsilon_2)$ exist, (ii) $\epsilon_2$ is independent of $\xi$ and $\epsilon_1$,
and (iii) the conditional expectation, $E(\epsilon_1 |\xi)=0$, while $\epsilon_1$ is not necessarily
independent of $\xi$.  Rao then proved that
the necessary and sufficient condition for
the regression of $x_1$ on
$x_2$ to be linear, whatever may be the constants ($a, b$), is that
the characteristic function of  $\xi$ is $exp[c|t|^d]$ 
and the characteristic function of  $\epsilon_2$ is $exp[c^\prime|t|^d]$.

\section{Application to cars data}
--sample file -- sample file----
--sample file -- sample file----
We let $y$ be the stopping distance of a car (in feet),
and $x$ be the speed of the car in miles per hour, using 
Ezekeil's data called `cars' always available in R. 
We are regressing $y$ on $x$ to show that faster a car is driving
longer is the distance before it comes to a full stop.

Our first R input code is:
\begin{Sinput}
rbind(head(cars,3),tail(cars,3)) # first \& last 3 row of data
nrow(cars)
\end{Sinput}
We have combined the first and last three rows of data for brevity in
the following R output.
\begin{Soutput}
> rbind(head(cars,3),tail(cars,3)) 
     speed dist
1      4    2
2      4   10
3      7    4
48    24   93
49    24  120
50    25   85
> nrow(cars)
[1] 50
\end{Soutput}

The R output above shows that `cars' data in R has $p=1, T=50$.
Instead of reporting the  (50$\times 2$) $X$ matrix,
brevity demands that we report the first three and last three rows of data. 

The simplest linear regression for cars data using R
is implemented by `lm' function creating an R object called `reg'
in the R code below.
\begin{Sinput}
library(stargazer)	
attach(cars) #to access columns by name
reg=lm(dist~speed) #standard R method for regression
stargazer(reg)
\end{Sinput}

The output of the above code is in a form suitable to produce
the following (Latex) Table \ref{tab.reg} where standard errors
of regression coefficients are in parentheses under the coefficient
values.
